# WebXR Moverio extension

WebXR Moverio extension is a browser extension which helps you connect your EPSON Moverio BT-40 AR glasses to the browser. It enables you to control the VRScene on a web page with your BT-40 connected to your PC.

This project is based on Mozilla's [WebXR Emulator extension](https://blog.mozvr.com/webxr-emulator-extension/). The changes are mostly on simplfying the source code at https://github.com/MozillaReality/WebXR-emulator-extension, and adding messages processing code from a native messaging host.
