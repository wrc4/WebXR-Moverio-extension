## Features

- [WebXR API polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill)
- Multiple XR devices emulation
- Both VR and AR support
- Graphical device emulator control with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- Cross browsers support with [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
<!-- - [Virtual controller (WIP)](./screenshots/virtual-controller.gif) -->

## Status

- Based on [WebXR device API draft issued on 10 October 2019](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/)
- No device specific emulation yet
- Supports only trigger and squeeze buttons, not other buttons

## Browsers

This extension is built on top of [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions). It works on Firefox, Chrome, and other browsers supporting the API.

## How to use

1. Go to the addon stores to install ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/webxr-api-emulator), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje))

2. Go to WebXR application page (for example [WebXR examples](#WebXR-examples)). You will notice that the application detects that you have a XR device (emulated) and it will let you enter the immersive (VR„ÄÅAR) mode.

3. Open "WebXR" tab in the browser developer tool ([Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)) to controll the emulated devices. You can move the headset and controllers, and trigger the controller buttons. You will see their transforms reflected in the WebXR application.

## How to control the emulated devices

By clicking a device in the devtool panel, you can select gizmo mode of the device. By dragging a gizmo, you can rotate or translate the device.

## Configuration

You can configure some settings from the top in the WebXR tab.

### Device

You can switch emulated device. The difference between devices is just degrees of freedom and the number of controllers for now.

| Device | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| None | No device |
| Google Cardboard | 3dof headset and no controller |
| HTC Vive | 6dof headset and two 6dof controllers |
| Oculus Go | 3dof headset and 3dof controller |
| Oculus Quest | 6dof headset and two 6dof controllers |
| Samsung Gear VR | 3dof headset and 3dof controller |

### Stereo Effect

You can enable/disable Stereo Effect which renders two views.

## AR mode

WebXR emulator extension also supports AR. You can test WebXR AR application on an emulated device in a virtual room, on your desktop browser.

### How to use

2. Select "Samsung Galaxy S8+ (AR)" device from the device list on the top of WebXR devtool panel

3. Go to WebXR application page, for example [Three.js WebXR AR examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr#webxr_ar_paint)

4. You will notice that the application detects that you have a XR device (emulated) and it will let you enter the immersive (AR) mode

5. AR application starts on the emulated device in a virtual room

### How to control

You can control the camera (view) and tablet in the application window.

| user action | camera/tablet control |
|----|----|
| Left mouse button drag | Camera rotation |
| Right mouse button drag | Camera pan |
| Middle mouse button drag or wheel | Move camera forward/backward |
